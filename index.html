    <h1>Ticker Board</h1>
    <p>This will be the landing page for my ticker board plugin.</p>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul class="create-ticker">
      <li>Vanilla JS</li>
      <li>CSS included</li>
      <li>Update message methods</li>
      <li>That's all so far</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's currently not accessible. There's no way a screen reader would have a
      good time reading these, for example. It is compatible with copying to
      clipboard, however. Hello.
    </p>

    <p>Known bugs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A race condition, whereby the result of firing off a change to a ticker
        board row while it's already processing one results in some letters
        potentially reflecting the earlier message
      </li>
